Modbus SDK for our turnstiles
==================

There are 2 versions of SDK:

**Delphi** version [here](https://github.com/lotltd/TurnstileModbusSDK/tree/master/TurnstileDelphi)

**C++** version for embedded devices [here](https://github.com/lotltd/TurnstileModbusSDK/tree/master/TurnstileCPP)


You can look at our turnstiles in our catalog here: http://old.lotgroup.eu/ru/index/catalog/

Turnstiles that currently works with modbus:

Any of the other turnstiles can be work via modbus by request. (now they have our proprietary protocol)
